<p> -I am not to much of a big picture guy, however I'd like to show you what pictures and short videos I think best describes me and my life. Consider this a montage with short descriptions of why I enjoy these photos. </p>

<p>- the reason why I enjoy the first photo is because growing up i ahve always liked bmw's ever since i could remember. Hopefully one of these days I can purchase a M3 or M4. You can consider this one of my dreams cars. The second picture is me at a cemterey where my father is. This is the place where I go to for a reset, it is a safe place for me and I enjoy being here when I need it. Second to last pictrue is Mexico vs Qatar, I enjoy soccer a lot and watching games is always fun. Lastly is my german rott, his name is saint. He is not that small anymore, he's a lot bigger now but that was him at twelve weeks.  </p>

<p>- I am thankful for the opporunity to go to Domicanian Republic. I was in Punta Cana, with four of my other friends. You are probably wonder where is the fourth friend. He unfortuntally slept in and missed out on this adventure. I really reccomend it for anyone who has not been it. If you are into the night life this is the place to go.</p>
